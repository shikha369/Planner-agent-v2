//The planner is a virtual intelligent assistant. 
//There are two agents- virtual assistant:v, user:u
//Scenario 1: The user is claustrophobic, and hence, prefers to take either a less crowded bus or walk to office. They share a common goal: reach office in time.
//fluents: crowded, sleepy, scared, ontime, walking 

//Other scenarios with assitive agents
//Scenario 2:
